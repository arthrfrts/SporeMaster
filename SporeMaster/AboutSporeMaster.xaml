            SporeMaster is an experimental Spore modding tool.  
            It aims to provide an integrated environment for exploring the Spore .package files and
            creating mods.

        <Paragraph>SporeMaster is unfinished, beta software.
            <Bold>It is provided without support and utterly
                        without warranty.</Bold>
            If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

                    .prop files to and from .xml.  files.xml is no longer necessary.

                    and DDS format respectively) with packages, making part creation possible 
                    for the first time.  Unpacking of these files is currently very limited.
                    Part animations are not yet supported.

                    aliases for hashes that can't be guessed (or that were randomly generated by EA).
                    The "Hash Guesser" tries more than 250 billion possible names for a given 
                    hash, providing you with a list of possible original names to choose from.
                    When a new name is found the unpacked files are automatically updated.
